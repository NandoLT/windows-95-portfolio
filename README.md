## 📤 Commit Message Guidelines
<details>

This project follows the **Conventional Commits** standard to ensure consistent and readable commit history. Each commit message should follow the structure below:

#### Commit Message Format


- **type**: Describes the category of the change. Examples include `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, and `build`.
- **scope** (optional): Clarifies what part of the codebase the change affects, such as `api`, `ui`, `auth`, etc.
- **subject**: A short, imperative description of the change, explaining what the commit does (e.g., `add login form validation`).

### Commit Types

| Type       | Description                                                    |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `feat`     | Adds a new feature                                             |
| `fix`      | Fixes a bug                                                    |
| `chore`    | General maintenance tasks, not affecting source code or tests  |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                                          |
| `style`    | Code style updates (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)     |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without adding features or fixing bugs        |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                                        |
| `test`     | Adding or updating tests                                       |
| `build`    | Changes affecting the build system or dependencies             |

### Examples

- **Feature**: `feat(auth): add user registration flow`
- **Bug Fix**: `fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue on mobile`
- **Chore**: `chore(deps): update eslint to latest version`
- **Documentation**: `docs(readme): update setup instructions`

### Additional Rules

- Keep the **subject line** to 50 characters or fewer.
- Use the **imperative mood** in the subject line (e.g., "add" not "adding").
- Capitalize the **type** and **scope** consistently (prefer lowercase).
- Avoid ending the **subject line** with a period.

By following these guidelines, the commit history will be clear, organized, and easy to understand.

### Examples

```bash
# Example commands for committing
git commit -m "feat(auth): add user registration flow"
git commit -m "fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue on mobile"
git commit -m "chore(deps): update eslint to latest version"
